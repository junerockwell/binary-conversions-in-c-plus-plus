# Binary Conversions
C++ app to convert binary to decimal and decimal to binary.

*Please note: This command line C++ app only takes in integers instead of doubles or floats. And, it only takes in binary with integer outputs.*

## NodeJS on the Terminal Counterpart

## Before running
- Make sure that you have a C++ compiler.

- What I've used is the `g++` compiler because I'm using MacOS. My MacOS also comes with `clang`.

To check if your system has `g++`, type in the command line `g++ --version`.

For this app, I compiled using `g++`.

## To run the app
1. To run the app and get started on inputting data to convert, download this repo to yours.
2. `mkdir` to the app's directory.
3. Compile by running `c++ binary_conversions.cpp -o conversions`
4. Then run, `./conversions`
